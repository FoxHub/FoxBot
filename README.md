FoxBot is a personable and entertaining social boat for Discord, written
in Python 3.6.2. I designed it for personal purposes, but it should be
well-commented enough to expand upon and configure for your own Discord
server.

FoxBot is licensed under the MIT license, which allows you to copy,
modify, and distribute it with attribution. See LICENSE.txt for details.


## Installation and Usage

Make sure you have [Python 3.6.2](https://www.python.org/downloads/) installed.
Then, you can use pip to install the requirements from requirements.txt.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

For the `<prefix>.speak` command to work, you'll also need to install [FFmpeg](http://FFmpeg.org) and
add it to your PATH, as well as set up an AWS account for use through the command line for Polly.

Finally, Fox-Bot's `config.json-EXAMPLE` must be renamed to `config.json` and filled with real
production data.
