FoxBot is a personable and entertaining social boat for Discord, written
in Python 3.6.2. I designed it for personal purposes, but it should be
well-commented enough to expand upon and configure for your own Discord
server.

FoxBot is licensed under the MIT license, which allows you to copy,
modify, and distribute it with attribution. See LICENSE.txt for details.


## Installation and Usage

Make sure you have [Python 3.6.2](https://www.python.org/downloads/) installed.
Then, you can use pip to install the requirements from requirements.txt.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

For the !speak command to work, you'll also need to install [FFmpeg](http://FFmpeg.org) and
add it to your PATH.
